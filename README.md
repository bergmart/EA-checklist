# EA-checklist
Companion repository for research in which a checklist was designed by which enterprise architects can assess a business case. 

This repository contains versions of a checklist that has been designed to support enterprise architects in their assessment of a business case. Version 6 of the checklist was used in an experiment with 33 architects. An improved version (7) was used in a second experiment with 25 architects. Based on this second experiment, improvements were made with version 8 as the final result.
